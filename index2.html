            <h2>Read Rhapsody of Realities Today</h2>
	    <body><h3>RHAPSODY OF REALITIES, DAILY DEVOTIONAL, THURSDAY 10TH AUGUST 2023.</br></h3>
            <h3>TOPIC:  ETERNAL LIFE IN YOU  </h3></br>
           <p> For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life (John 3:16 NIV).</p></br>
            <p>The opening verse is a profound statement from Jesus. It says whoever believes in Him, shall not perish but have eternal life; that’s you. It also brings to mind the words of Scripture in Colossians 1:26-27: “Even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints: To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.”</p></br>
           <p>Christ in you means eternal life within! This subject in scripture calls for deep meditation. First, let’s consider the definition of eternal life. What exactly is it? Eternal life refers to the life and nature of God: that is, the God-life. Just as there is plant life and animal life, the animal life can further be categorized into human life and various other forms of biological life.</p></br>
           <p> However, there’s a distinct kind of life—the God-life. God is the author of life, and everything we consider as “life” emanates from Him. He is life personified. Thus, His very life, His nature, was birthed within us when we were born again. Does this mean we possess two lives?” No! </p></br>
           <p> When you were born again, a new life was introduced into your spirit, and the human life with which you were born of your earthly parents was supplanted by the life and nature of God. The Bible says, “Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new” (2 Corinthians 5:17).</p></br> <p>This simply implies that we’re divine beings, divine creatures, and our divine nature makes us masters over circumstances, with dominion over Satan and the world’s deplorable systems. No wonder the Apostle Peter calls us associates of a heavenly pantheon—comrades of the God-kind (2 Peter 1:4). Hallelujah!</p></br>
           <p><h3> CONFESSION </h3></p>
My divine nature has made me a master over circumstances, with dominion over the world’s deplorable systems. My old life has been completely supplanted by the divine life, which is superior to sickness, disease, defeat and all depravities that affect the natural man. The nature of righteousness causes me to walk in God’s perfect will today, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.</br>
<h3>FURTHER STUDY</h3></br> Galatians 2:20 I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me. </br>
1 John 5:11-13 NIV And this is the testimony: God has given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. 12 Whoever has the Son has life; whoever does not have the Son of God does not have life. 13 I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God so that you may know that you have eternal life. </br>
1 John 4:17 Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world. </br>
