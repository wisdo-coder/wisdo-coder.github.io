            <h2>Release of WAEC Results</h2>
	    <body><h2>Announcement of WAEC Exam Results</h2>
            <p>The West African Examinations Council, WAEC, has published the outcomes of the 2023 West African Senior School Certificate Examinations (WASSCE).</p>
            
            <p>The Nigeria National Office of the West African Examinations Council (WAEC), Mr. Patrick Areghan, revealed the release of the results on Monday during a press briefing at its headquarters in Yaba, Lagos State.</p>
            
            <p>The examination organization mentioned that eight states, which owe the West African Examinations Council for various services rendered, will not have the WASSCE results for their candidates in 2023 released.</p>
            
            <p>Around 1.6 million candidates participated in the exam.</p>
            
            <p>Patrick stated that the results of the 2023 West African Senior School Certificate Examination (WASSCE) can now be accessed along with the candidates' certificates.</p>
            
            <p>WAEC expressed concerns about the challenges posed by the inability of some states to pay for services rendered.</p>
            
            <p>The examination body indicated that out of the total of 1,613,733 candidates who sat for the exam, the results of 262,803 candidates are being withheld due to reports of examination malpractice.</p>
            
            <p>Mr. Patrick announced an improved pass rate, with 1,361,608 candidates (84.38%) obtaining credit or higher in at least five subjects, with or without English Language or Mathematics.</p>
            
            <p>Additionally, 1,287,920 candidates (79.81%) obtained credits or higher in a minimum of five subjects, including English Language and Mathematics.</p>
            
            <p>He mentioned, "I'm pleased to inform that candidates who took the 2023 WASSCE and have no outstanding issues can access their results, including their certificates."</p>
            
            <p>"About eight states have outstanding payments to WAEC. We won't name them all as some are in the process of making payments.</p>
            
            <p>However, Zamfara and Niger states have the highest outstanding debts. Furthermore, Zamfara did not present any candidates for this year's WASSCE."</p>
            
            <p>A total of 1,621,853 SS3 students from 20,851 secondary schools registered for the WASSCE. Among them, 798,810 were males, representing 49.25%, while 823,043 were females, constituting 50.75% of the total candidature.</p>
            
            <p>According to WAEC, the statistics show a further change in the number of females and males compared to the 2022 exam.</p>
